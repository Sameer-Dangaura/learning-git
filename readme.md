# learning-git

This repository is created for practicing and learning the basics of Git.

## ðŸ›  What Iâ€™ve Learned So Far

In this repository, I practiced the following Git concepts using simple text files:

- `git init` â€“ Initialize a new Git repository.
- `git add` â€“ Stage changes to be committed.
- `git commit` â€“ Save changes to the local repository with a message.
- `git branch` â€“ Create and manage branches.
- `git checkout` â€“ Switch between branches.
- `git merge` â€“ Merge one branch into another.
- `git stash` â€“ Temporarily save changes not ready to commit.
- `git diff` â€“ Compare changes in files or between commits.
- `git rebase` â€“ Reapply commits on top of another base branch.

## ðŸ“„ How I Practiced

- Created and edited a plain `.txt` file.
- Added different lines of text for each Git concept.
- Committed changes after every step to understand Git workflows.
- Used branches to test changes independently.
- Used `stash` to hide changes and restore them later.
- Observed differences with `diff` before and after changes.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

The purpose of this repo is purely educational â€” to build a strong foundation in Git and version control.

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- No real code or project files.
- Only text files were used to simulate version-controlled development.
